\description{
Initializes a \code{data_stack} object. Principally, \code{data_stack}s are just
tibbles, where the first column gives the true outcome in the assessment set,
and the remaining columns give the predictions from each candidate ensemble
member. (When the outcome is numeric, thereâ€™s only one column per ensemble
member. Multi-way classification requires more columns.) They also bring
along a few extra attributes to keep track of model definitions, resamples,
and training data.
