\title{stacks: Tidy Model Stacking Stools}

Model stacking is an ensembling technique
    that involves training a model to combine the outputs of many 
    diverse statistical models, and has been shown to improve 
    predictive performance in a variety of settings. 'stacks' 
    implements a grammar for 'tidymodels'-aligned model stacking.

\details{
At the highest level, ensembles are formed from \emph{model definitions}. In
this package, model definitions are an instance of a minimal
\href{https://workflows.tidymodels.org/}{workflow}, containing a \emph{model
specification} (as defined in the
\href{https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/}{parsnip} package) and, optionally, a
\emph{preprocessor} (as defined in the
\href{https://recipes.tidymodels.org/}{recipes} package). Model definitions
specify the form of candidate ensemble members.

To be used in the same ensemble, each of these model definitions must
share the same \emph{resample}. This
\href{https://rsample.tidymodels.org/}{rsample} \code{rset} object, when paired
with the model definitions, can be used to generate the tuning/fitting
results objects for the candidate \emph{ensemble members} with tune.

The package will sometimes refer to \emph{sub-models}. An ensemble member is
a sub-model that has actually been selected (and possibly trained) for
use in the ensemble (via nonzero stacking coefficients, usually) that is
not regarded as resulting from a specific model definition, where-as a
sub-model is an untrained candidate ensemble member.

Candidate members first come together in a \code{data_stack} object through
the \code{add_candidates()} function. Principally, these objects are just
\href{https://tibble.tidyverse.org/}{tibble}s, where the first column gives
the true outcome in the assessment set, and the remaining columns give
the predictions from each candidate ensemble member. (When the outcome
is numeric, there’s only one column per candidate ensemble member.
Classification requires as many columns per candidate as there are
levels in the outcome variable.) They also bring along a few extra
attributes to keep track of model definitions.

Then, the data stack can be evaluated using \code{blend_predictions()} to
determine to how best to combine the outputs from each of the candidate
members.

The outputs of each member are likely highly correlated. Thus, depending
on the degree of regularization you choose, the coefficients for the
inputs of (possibly) many of the members will zero out—their predictions
will have no influence on the final output, and those terms will thus be
thrown out.

These stacking coefficients determine which candidate ensemble members
will become ensemble members. Candidates with non-zero stacking
coefficients are then fitted on the whole training set, altogether
making up a \code{model_stack} object.

This model stack object, outputted from \code{fit_members()}, is ready to
predict on new data!

At a high level, the process follows these steps:

The API for the package closely mirrors these ideas. See the \code{basics}
vignette for an example of how this grammar is implemented!
