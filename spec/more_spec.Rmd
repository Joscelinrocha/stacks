Data setup:
* Split into testing/training (`rsample::initial_split()`, `rsample::training()`, `rsample::testing()`)
* Cross validation (`rsample::vfold_cv()`)
* Pre-processing (`recipes::recipe()`, `recipes::step_*()`)

Create an object to supply to `tune::tune_grid()` calls that ensures predictions are saved. (`tune::control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)`)

Set metric. (`yardstick::metric_set()`)

Build constituent models. For each:
* Extend pre-processing, if necessary. (more `recipes::step_*()`)
* Set a model specification (with parsnip or rules)
* Choose a package (`parsnip::set_engine()`)
* Possibly: create a workflow (`workflows::workflow()`, `workflows::add_recipe()`, `workflows::add_model()`), tune hyperparameters (`tune::tune_grid()`) (possibly using a workflow)
