#' Initialize a data stack
#' 
#' Initializes a `data_stack` object. Principally, `data_stack`s are just
#' tibbles, where the first column gives the true outcome in the assessment set,
#' and the remaining columns give the predictions from each candidate ensemble 
#' member. (When the outcome is numeric, thereâ€™s only one column per candidate 
#' member. For classification, there are as many columns per candidate
#' member as there are levels in the outcome variable.) They also bring 
#' along a few extra attributes to keep track of model definitions, resamples,
#' and training data.
#' 
#' @param ... Additional arguments. Currently ignored.
#' 
#' @return A `data_stack` object.
